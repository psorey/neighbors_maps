###Interactive GIS Mapping for a Neighborhood Project



This interactive mapping tool was originally designed for a Seattle neighborhood project, to gather data from each participating neighbor about their experiences walking in the neighborhood:

* existing patterns of pedestrian circulation
* frequented destinations
* problem areas, safety issues
* opportunity zones





I was web communications consultant and member of the design team, funded by a Seattle Department of Neighborhoods Large Grant to study the area and plan an approach to understanding existing conditions and designing improvements to streets and paths. 

The other design team members were a landscape architect, a civil engineer, a social outreach specialist, and a finance specialist to research possible funding sources.
