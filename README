Greenwood Streetscapes

An online 'social DESIGN network' tool with interactive GIS maps, database of neighborhood users, with links to a Nabble forum for discussion and a wiki for creating content.

Using Mapserver, PostGIS, OpenLayers, and ruby mapscript, City of Seattle GIS layers can be displayed and logged-in users can create their own layers to be displayed over the other layers.

This is an on-going project: as community groups use the tool I will respond with new functionality to meet their needs.
